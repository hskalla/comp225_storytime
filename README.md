### Dawn of the Posessed Behemoth at the End of Time

As the End of Time draws near, Sam has to avoid the Behemoth, which is now posessed and more dangerous than ever!

Chapter 1: The Beginning of the End

The End of Time draws near. The year 1.7x10^106 is known throughout all of human civilization as the End of Time, as this is *obviously* when the heat death of the universe will occur. Sam is a 17-year-old living in Earthland. They are terrified of the End of Time because having everything ever in the universe disappear would suck.

But as Sam deals with their grief, it's clear that their troubles have only just begun. In the final year of the universe, it is becoming clear that the friendly neighborhood behemoth is now... posessed!!!

Chapter 2: The Posessed Behemoth

The granola bar I ate on the way over here was not quite as filling as I had hoped. I feel like I've been perpetually hungry for the past month or so. Such an annnoying problem to have. Truly unsolveable.

Chapter 3: The End of Time

After the behemoth went on its rampage, it appeared to the last human settlers of the last solar system in the galaxy. They had feared this day for many years, having forsaw this catastrophe long ago. When the behemoth arrived, it said "And now, you become me," and the monks of the last planet finally saw through the behemoths eyes. For even in their wisdom, they had not understood its cause. Now, at the end of time and the universe, the behemoth granted them a small bit of joy. And then, the behemoth was gone.

Secret Chapter 4: After the End

After the behemoth was there, then all the green aliens from the other universe came over and were really chill.
