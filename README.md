After the behemoth went on its rampage, it appeared to the last human settlers of the last solar system in the galaxy. They had feared this day for many years, having forsaw this catastrophe long ago. When the behemoth arrived, it said "And now, you become me," and the monks of the last planet finally saw through the behemoths eyes. For even in their wisdom, they had not understood its cause.
